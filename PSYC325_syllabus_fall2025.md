## Course Objectives

The goal of this class is to familiarize you with concepts and empirical research on [adult psychopathology](https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Contents.pdf); we may address children and adolescents when pertinent. I designed the course to be broken into modules. Each module lasts a few weeks. Every day we meet, I present small lectures of material relevant to the module content. After each lecture, we discuss the material as a class. My plan is to treat this course as a stimulating seminar where we exchange ideas and, perhaps, disagree. Our collective goal is to learn from one another. As far as the course content, I focus on the big diagnostic categories where most people are likely to fall within their lifetime. Specifically, we discuss:

- **Diagnosis and classification** - naming the pathological behavior
- **Epidemiology** - the extent of the problem is it in society
- **Pathogenesis** - how did it develop?; what keeps it going?
  - **Genetic** - what hand was a person dealt that leads to certain problems?
  - **Neurobiological** - a mixed bag of causes and effects
  - **Psychosocial factors** - another mixed bag

Since interventions lie beyond the scope of the course, I plan to discuss them sparingly to provide evidence of differential diagnosis or etiological concerns.

### By the end of the course, you will be able to:

1. **Describe, compare and contrast** various symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions, panic attacks) associated with psychological disorders.
2. **Understand** the continuity between non-pathological and pathological behavior, including socio-cultural factors influencing the definition of such pathologies and grasping the difference between dimensional and categorical approaches.
3. **Appreciate** the frequency and distribution of these problems in the United States and elsewhere (i.e., epidemiology).
4. **Recognize** the ways in which psychologists ask research questions about these disorders and the various research methods by which they seek answers to these questions. There is an important distinction between useful data and meaningless statistics.

### Scientific Approach

The scientific investigation of pathological behavior carries with it the assumption that doing so is justifiable - that is, that psychopathology **can** be studied objectively. Scientists often adopt an open-minded skepticism that gets addressed with data. We do not seek just any data but rather data collected from appropriate samples, designs, and measures. I shall treat all the topics we discuss with the same level of rigor expected in the scientific community. I ask you to do the same. We are going to discuss several controversial topics, including sexual behaviors, drug use, and crime. In order to get the most out of this class, you may have to set aside -- at least temporarily -- personal beliefs that you have already acquired about psychopathology. Remain open but skeptical like a scientist.

### Assigned Readings and Lectures

To get the most out of the course, you must read both the assigned materials (brief by most standards) and the lecture notes **BEFORE** class. Please read; failure to do so means that you will waste your time by attending lectures when you could be doing something more interesting and our collective time by chiming in with uninformed opinions. The course is not about opinions but rather about empirical evidence. Read the assigned materials and you will see that most of the opinions held by the general population are misinformed and, sadly, outdated. By participating in class, you engage in the learning process, assess the ideas presented, and shape the focus of the class. Class becomes more dynamic, interesting and rewarding when students actively share their ideas, objections, critiques, and questions. You are expected to come to class having read the assigned material and be prepared to make comments, raise questions, and offer counter evidence - **not opinion**. Every aspect of this class outside of the classroom is free. The assigned readings come from all free resources. Yes, the **TEXTBOOK IS FREE!** (via the **[Noba Project](http://nobaproject.com/)**). I chose this text for its price and the fact that the chapters were written by the foremost experts in each area we discuss. The material comes as condensed online pieces that ought to take less than 60 minutes to read and understand the material. Thus, I chose materials that were expertly crafted, accurate, and inexpensive.

## Course Structure

The course consists of four (4) modules - one required module and three "optional" modules. Module 1 (Classification of Psychopathology) is required. Everyone must attend Module 1 lectures and complete Exam 1. After that module, you may select from any of the three remaining modules including depressive (Module 2) and anxiety (Module 3) disorders, along with a combined module (Module 4) covering personality, substance use disorders, and other diagnostic groups. I labeled them as "optional" since you are only required to complete two of the three remaining modules.

## Grading and Evaluation

I use three pieces of evidence to assign your final grade: attendance, exam performance, and attending to instructions.

### Attendance (50 pts)
*"Showing up is 80 percent of life"* – [Woody Allen](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/06/10/showing-up/)

You will learn more from me and your classmates in person than by any other means. Consistent with Woody Allen's perspective, I plan to take attendance. How? Every session we meet, at about 15 minutes into the class, I will take a photograph of all those present and, counted as in attendance. These AI tools now allow me to take attendance each day. I do this to ensure that everyone commits to showing up every week, every day, and every minute the course is in session. I give you all ample leniency with respect to showing up ON TIME. I ask you, please be sitting and ready to participate **NO LATER THAN 5 MINUTES AFTER 9AM (i.e., 9:05AM)**. Some students have gotten into the very bad habit of showing up (yes!!!) but showing up 30 minutes after the class started (boo!!). So, show up, show up on time, and, if you can muster it, show up early. I am often in the classroom with plenty of time to chat.

### Exams (40 pts)
There will be four (4) exams with the best three (3) used to compute your grade. Each exam assesses your understanding of material presented in the lectures and the assigned readings for each module. **Exam 1 is mandatory for all students.** After Exam 1, you need only take two additional exams from Exams 2, 3, or 4 to complete the course requirements. **Exam 4 will be offered during the final exam period for those who wish to take it.** Students satisfied with their performance after the first three exams may skip Exam 4. Exams must be taken on the scheduled date, in person, and without exception. There will be no makeup exams. Let me repeat myself. **THERE WILL BE NO MAKEUP EXAMS.** Plan ahead. Plan for deaths, weddings, babies, and such. Whatever you do, plan. The best plan is to take all four exams. The exams are in class with no notes, no devices, and no help from the outside world (hello ChatGPT); these exams will be challenging but fair.

### Listening (10 pts)
I make announcements routinely throughout the semester and remind students frequently about deadlines, changes, and such. Your job is to listen and follow instructions. You get a free 10% boost in your grade if you simply follow instructions. You know, listen.

## Final Grades

Your grade will be determined by your attendance (50 pts), the average of your **3 highest exam scores** (40 pts) and you **following instructions** (10 pts). If I ask the class to please follow directions (e.g., read the syllabus, listen to announcements, and such) then you know that failure to do so eliminates 10% of your final grade. Egregious offenses need not apply for any leniency. Please follow directions. I refuse to give any student an A who fails to follow simple directions - especially after being prompted to follow directions. Yes, refuse.

### Grading Scale

| Grade | A+ | A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C | D | F |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
| **TOTAL** | 100 | 93-99 | 90-92 | 87-89 | 83-86 | 80-82 | 70-79 | 61-69 | 0-60 |

### Compute your own grade

**TOTAL = Exam Average × 40 + (# of classes attended / 26) × 50 + (did you listen: Yes = 1, No = 0) × 10**

Tally up your TOTAL and then compare that value to the grading scale. Let me give you an example. Suppose you average 70% on 3 of the 4 exams, attended all but two classes (24 out of 26) or 92.3% of the classes, and you listened (thank you). Based upon those numbers, your TOTAL is…

**TOTAL** = 70% of 40 (pts) + 92.3% of 50 (pts) + 100% of 10 (pts) = 28 + 46.15 + 10 = 84.15 (**B**)

Expect a **"B"** for the course. Note, you only averaged about a "C" on the exams but by showing up and listening, you got the benefit of the doubt and scored a better grade. Ain't that cool?

### Some details to consider…

1. You cannot pass the course (Grade > F) without attending AT LEAST 5 lectures provided you have 100% on the exams and you listen.
2. Attendance offsets your poor performance on exams. If you fail the exams or perform poorly, your grade will suffer in most classes but not as much in this class. Consider a simple example:
   - 50% Exam Average (20 pts)
   - 100% Attendance (50 pts)
   - You listened (10 pts)
   - FINAL GRADE: 20 + 50 + 10 = 80 (**B-**)
3. You must average at least 50% on the exams to earn a B grade - remember that point when I send out the grades on the exams. To be clear, you only need to score an average of 50% on the exams provided you attend all the classes, listen, and only care about getting a low B or B-.
